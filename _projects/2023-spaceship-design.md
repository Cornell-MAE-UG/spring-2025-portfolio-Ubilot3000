As part of a mechanical design class, student teams were tasked with the semester-long initiative of identifying a gap in the market which could be filled through an innovative design. To start off, the group conducted numerous interviews, spoke to various interest groups, and evaluated their own strengths and abilities. The design space that was settled upon, was improving the tooling industry. Particularily, a commmon struggle was idenfitied between students and hobbyists alike. Oftentimes, individuals struggled to find room to store their tools. Similarly, tools were always bulky and had ultra-specific use cases, lacking universality.

The solution identified was the combination of a wrench and screwdriver, offering the best of both worlds. Commonly, screwdrivers have the ability to store multiple screw bits inside of them. Unfortunately, their hand-held nature restricts them from being high-torque, limiting the end user. Wrenches were also identified as, like screwdrivers, commonly used hobbyist devices. Accordingly, an effort was made to combine the two functions. Thus came the Torquemaster series.

The first prototype was a wooden variant, intended to prioritize mechanical strength and withstand load testing. Tested until failure, the group learned that the grain of the wood significantly compromised the structural rigidity of the prototype, not meeting its expected targets.

The second prototype tested for functionality and incorporated the screw-holding compartment, which now featured a magnetic locking mechanism. The tests conducted with this second prototype allowed it to find key user-focused features that were lacking, such as filleted sides, and better incorporated magnets on the compartment and screw-bit hole.

Overall, this project allowed the group to see further into the design process. Projects like Design Build Fly tend to prioritize fancy design for manufacturing performance, as only a few models are built each year. However, focusing on the potential manufacturing of hundreds of models gave a different view to the process and encouraged new ways of thought.
